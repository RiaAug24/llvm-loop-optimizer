# LLVM Loop Unroll Optimization Pass

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and use a custom **LLVM optimization pass** to perform **loop unrolling** on LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). The custom pass is implemented as a shared library plugin and can be loaded using the `opt` tool from LLVM.

Loop unrolling is a classic compiler optimization that reduces loop overhead and potentially improves performance by executing multiple iterations of a loop in a single iteration.

##  Requirements

- LLVM (version 12 or newer recommended)
- CMake
- Clang / opt (from LLVM)
- MSYS2/MinGW (on Windows)
- C++ compiler

---

## Building the Plugin

1. **Clone this repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llvm-loop-optimizer.git
cd llvm-loop-optimizer
```

2. **Create a build directory**:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

3. **Configure the build using CMake**:

```bash
cmake ..
```

4. **Build the plugin**:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

After successful build, the plugin shared library (`libLoopUnrollPass.dll` on Windows or `.so` on Linux) will be located in the `build/` directory.

## Running the Optimization

### Step 1: Compile the Test File to LLVM IR

From the project root:

```bash
clang++ -S -emit-llvm ./test/test.cpp -o test.ll
```

This generates `test.ll` — the LLVM IR of your C++ file.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Loop Unroll Pass

```bash
opt -load-pass-plugin ./libLoopUnrollPass.dll -passes=loop-unroll -S test.ll -o optimized.ll
```

- `-load-pass-plugin`: Loads your custom pass.
- `-passes=loop-unroll`: Applies your custom pass.
- `-S`: Outputs human-readable LLVM IR.
- `optimized.ll`: The transformed IR file.

---

## Expected Output

- **Before**: `test.ll` contains loop structures, `br` instructions, and PHI nodes.
- **After**: `optimized.ll` should contain **duplicated loop bodies**, **fewer branches**, and possibly **flattened control flow**.

If `optimized.ll` is unreadable (binary), you may have missed the `-S` flag. Add it to get IR output in text format.

---

## Sample Input (test.cpp)

```cpp
void loop_example() {
    int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i] + 1;
    }
}
```
